Florida Bay Assessment Model (BAM)

BAM is a 'basins' hydrological model of Florida Bay.  It is mass-conservative and explicitly designed to assess water levels and salinities in 54 idealized basins representing Florida Bay.  Basins are separated and connected by shoals, thereby the model conforms to a linked-node network hierarchy with basins as nodes and shoals as links.  Model inputs include rainfall, evaporation, tidal elevations and freshwater runoff from the Everglades.  Inter-basin fluxes are driven by hydraulic gradients developed across the shoals in response to water level elevations and are modeled with Manning's equation. 

A good place to start are the docstrings in Notes.py, and a perusal of the command line options (e.g. ./bam.py -h). 

Important options for run control:

  -p PATH, --path PATH    : Top level path of BAM: -p /opt/hydro/models/PyBAM/
  -t TIMESTEP, --timestep : TIMESTEP timestep (s): -t 360
  -S START, --start START : Start date time: -S "2010-01-01 00:00"
  -E END, --end END       : End date time:   -E "2010-01-01 08:00"
  -oi OUTPUTINTERVAL, --outputInterval OUTPUTINTERVAL :
                        Time interval (hr) of output data: -oi 1
  -bo BASINOUTPUTDIR, --basinOutput BASINOUTPUTDIR :
                        Directory to write basin outputs: -bo /home/jpark/BAM.out


Note:
In a departure from traditional numerical models, BAM is pure Python.
